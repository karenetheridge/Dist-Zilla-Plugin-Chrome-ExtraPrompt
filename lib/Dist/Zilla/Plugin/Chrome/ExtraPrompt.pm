=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<~/.dzil/config.ini> (B<NOT> F<dist.ini>):

    [Chrome::ExtraPrompt]
    command = say Dist zilla would like your attention.
    repeat_prompt = 1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a L<Dist::Zilla> plugin that is loaded from your
F<~/.dzil/config.ini>, which affects the behaviour of prompts within
L<Dist::Zilla> commands. When you are prompted, the specified command is run;
it is killed when you provide prompt input.

I have mine configured as in the synopsis, which uses the C<say> command on
OS X to provide an audio prompt to bring me back to this screen session.

=head1 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

=head2 C<command>

The string containing the command and arguments to call.  required.

=head2 C<repeat_prompt>

A boolean flag (defaulting to false) that, when set,
appends the prompt string to the command and arguments that are called,
passing as a single (additional?) argument.
